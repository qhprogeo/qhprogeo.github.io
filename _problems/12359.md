Consider the function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following functional equation for all real numbers $x$ and $y$:

$$ f(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2f(x)f(y) $$

Additionally, it is given that $f(0) = 1$.

1. Prove that $f$ is an even function, i.e., $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
2. Determine whether $f$ is periodic. If it is, find the smallest positive period.
3. Find all possible functions $f$ that satisfy the given functional equation.

Furthermore, consider the case where $f$ is differentiable. Show that the only differentiable solutions to the functional equation are of the form $f(x) = \cos(kx)$ for some constant $k$.

Finally, analyze the behavior of $f$ when $x \to \infty$. Discuss whether $f$ remains bounded or unbounded as $x$ increases without bound.
