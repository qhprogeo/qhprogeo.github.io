Prove that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.

Consider a triangle $ABC$. Extend the side $BC$ to a point $D$. Let $\angle BAC = \alpha$, $\angle ABC = \beta$, and $\angle ACB = \gamma$.

By the exterior angle theorem, the exterior angle $\angle ACD$ is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Therefore, $\angle ACD = \alpha + \beta$.

Since $\angle ACD$ and $\angle ACB$ form a linear pair, their sum is $180^\circ$. Thus, we have:
$$
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 180^\circ
$$

Hence, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.
