Given a triangle $ABC$. A circle $\Gamma$ is tangent to $(ABC)$ at $A$ and tangent to side $BC$ at $D$. The circle $\Gamma$ intersects $CA$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $K$ and $L$ be the reflections of $D$ across $C$ and $B$, respectively. Let $P$ be the intersection of lines $LF$ and $KE$. The lines $PF$ and $PE$ intersect $\Gamma$ again at $M$ and $N$, respectively. Let $DJ$ be the diameter of $\Gamma$. The perpendicular bisector of $KL$ intersects line $AD$ at $X$. Prove that the circles $(PMN)$, $(XKL)$, and $(J, JD)$ are tangent to each other.
