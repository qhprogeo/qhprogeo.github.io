In $\triangle ABC$ with altitudes $AD, BE, CF$, the Euler lines of the triangles $\triangle AEF, \triangle BFD, \triangle CDE$ concur at a point $J$. Let $Fe$ be the Feuerbach point of $\triangle ABC$. Define $\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}$ as unit direction vectors of the Euler lines of $\triangle AEF, \triangle BFD, \triangle CDE$, respectively. Prove that it is possible to choose signs $+$ or $-$ such that the vector $\pm\vec{u} \pm\vec{v} \pm\vec{w}$ is perpendicular to $JFe$.
