Given a triangle $ABC$ with $I$ as the incenter. A line passing through $A$ intersects the circle $(IBC)$ at points $J$ and $L$. The line $\ell$, passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $BC$, intersects the lines $BJ$, $CJ$, $BL$, and $CL$ at points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$, respectively. Let $AI$ intersect $BC$ at $D$, and let $AK$ be the diameter of $(ABC)$. Prove that the lines $KD$, $\ell$, and the line joining the centers of the circles $(JPQ)$ and $(LRS)$ are concurrent.
