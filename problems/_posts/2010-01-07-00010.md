Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $(O)$. Denote $E, F, G$ as the intersections of the pairs of lines $AB, CD$; $AD, BC$; and $AC, BD$, respectively. Prove that
$$
\frac{OG \cdot EF}{AC \cdot BD} = \frac{bdk + ack^{-1}}{4S}
$$
where $AB = a$, $BC = b$, $CD = c$, $DA = d$, and $k = \left| \frac{a^2 - c^2}{b^2 - d^2} \right|$, while $S$ is the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$.
