Given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $(O)$. Let $D$ be a point on $(O)$ such that the line $AD$ intersects $(BOC)$ at points $E$ and $F$. Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $(BOC)$. The lines $PE$ and $PF$ intersect $BC$ at points $M$ and $N$, respectively. The circle $(PMN)$ intersects $(O)$ at points $Q$ and $R$. Prove that if $AQ$ and $RD$ are concurrent with $BC$, then $DQ$ and $AR$ intersect on $(PQR)$, or vice versa.
