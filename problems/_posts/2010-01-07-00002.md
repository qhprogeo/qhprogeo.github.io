Given a triangle $ABC$ with its incircle $\omega$ touching $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$ respectively. Let $P$ be the external homothety center of $\omega$ and $(ABC)$. Suppose the rays opposite to $PB$ and $PC$ intersect $\omega$ at $Q$ and $R$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the reflections of $D$ across $Q$ and $R$, respectively. Choose $J$ such that $JM \parallel EQ$ and $JN \parallel FR$. On the sides $DE$ and $DF$, select points $K$ and $L$ such that $EL = ED$ and $FK = FD$. Prove that the circles $(DKL)$ and $(JMN)$ are tangent to each other.
