Given a triangle $ABC$, let $D$ be the point where the incircle $(I)$ touches $BC$. The line through $I$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $CA$ and $AB$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $J$ and $L$ be the reflections of $I$ over $DF$ and $DE$, respectively. Point $P$ is chosen inside triangle $ABC$ such that $DP \parallel AI$ and $DP \cdot AI = ID^2$. The line $PI$ intersects the perpendicular bisector of $JL$ at $K$. Prove that the circle $(K)$, passing through $J$ and $L$, is tangent to the circle centered at $A$ that passes through $I$.
