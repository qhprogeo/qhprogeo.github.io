Given the function $f(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{1 + t^2} \, dt$, find the value of $f'(x)$ and evaluate $f(\pi)$.

Additionally, consider the series $S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$. Determine whether the series converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum.

Finally, solve the following differential equation:
$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4\frac{dy}{dx} + 4y = 0$
with the initial conditions $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = 0$.
