Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $L$ as the reflection of the orthocenter over the circumcenter. Let $D, E, F$ be the projections of $L$ onto $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. Prove that $AD, BE, CF$ are concurrent at a point lying on the line connecting the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$ and the symmedian point of triangle $DEF$.
